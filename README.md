# Learning Programming in Python 🐍

This repository documents my programming learning journey, from the very basics to more advanced projects.  
Here I will be uploading weekly exercises, mini-projects, and notes.

## 📅 Structure

- **Week 1:** Variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, and functions.
- **Week 2:** (Coming soon) Lists, tuples, dictionaries, file handling, and a task manager mini-project.
- **Week 3+:** Object-oriented programming, modules, larger projects, etc.

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to build a solid foundation in programming logic and Python,  
to later advance to software development and artificial intelligence topics.

## ⚡ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Editor:** VS Code  
- **Version control:** Git & GitHub  

## 🚀 Progress

I update this repository every week with new exercises and projects.  
If you want to follow my progress, give this repo a ⭐ or check each week's folder.
